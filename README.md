# Smart contract registry

## Introduction

The smart contracts of a protocol contain the relevant information regarding how the protocol works, and how its tokenholders can propose, vote, and implement changes to the protocol over time.

An up-to-date registry of a protocolâ€™s smart contracts makes it easy for different stakeholders to learn more about the different functions of a protocol, and analyse how those evolve over time.

## How this repo is structured

The registry file contains a list of objects with the following example data (from `compound.json`):

```
{
    "name": "cAAVE",
    "address": "0xe65cdB6479BaC1e22340E4E755fAE7E509EcD06c",
    "chain": "ethereum",
    "version": "v2",
    "type": "core",
    "description": "Includes the logic for the AAVE lending market and the associated cAAVE token",
    "explorers": [
        "https://etherscan.io/address/0xe65cdb6479bac1e22340e4e755fae7e509ecd06c"
    ]
}
```

Each project has a registry file under `projects/` folder with their respective name, e.g. `compound.json`. Each smart contract addition is a new entry to a project's registry file.

Check out the `template.json` to see a field-by-field example.

## How to contribute

First of all, thank you for being awesome and taking the time to contribute. Being able to gather all relevant smart contracts in the ecosystem is a community-effort, which you are part of.

### Forking the repo

In order for you to contribute, you will have to fork our repo. Check this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) on how to do that.

### Creating a branch

We want to encourage best practices in the creation of branches. Having consistent branch naming makes the intial step of the review clear. We focus on two main naming conventions: `feature type` and `description`.

In this repo we have two feature types: the ones that add a new project (`add`) to the repo and the ones that update an existing project (`update`).

An example branch name could be: `update_compound_comptroller`. A bad one would be `test2`.

### Creating a commit

We enforce the usage of `commitlint`. It has same principles as in the creation of a branch. You can check out https://commitlint.js.org/ for more info.

### Creating a Pull Request

Creating a Pull Request from a fork is as easy as creating one within the repo. You can check out more info from [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).
